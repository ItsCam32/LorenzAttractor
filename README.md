<h1>Lorenz Attractor (Unity)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Lorenz Attractor is a type of Lorenz System named after Edward Lorenz, which is a system of seemingly normal differential equations that provide chaotic and wildly differing results when the parameter values and initial condtions are changed even very slightly. The well-used term "Butterfly Effect" was influenced by the results from the Lorenz Attractor. This simulation provides a 3D recreation of this effect and a colourful visualisation of how the enticing effect changes over time.
